3. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
    - I used this site to understand how to use the http service (https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt6)
    - I used this as a start on how to get the local url (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46024978/concatenate-a-string-with-a-hyperlink)
    - I also used the resources provided in the assingment page (bootstrap, w3schools, etc)

4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?

I did not consult my classmates but I did consult my dad when I was stuck debugging. I asked for his advice when trying to
solve issues regarding the album page, thermometer and carousel functions. 


5. Did you add a bonus feature to your submission? If so, what is it and how should we see it?
N/a


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
I did edit the resource-data.ts file to access the local url. Also I was not able to access artist, album, and track pages from other 
pages aside from the homepage. I was unsure if that was a requirement but I could not figure out how to make it function properly
